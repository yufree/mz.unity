Title: Detection of Complex Relationships In Mass Spectra
Description: mz.unity is a collection of algorithms used for annotation of
    high resolution mass spectra. The approach is charge aware, enabling the
    incorporation of information relating neutral, positive, and negative ions
    within the algorithm. mz.unity can annotate fine isotopic peaks, mass and/or charge shifts (adducts,
    neutral losses), and complex relationships such as multimers and some fragments.
